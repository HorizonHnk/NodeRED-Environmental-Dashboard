# Node-RED Environmental Monitoring Dashboard
> A comprehensive pollution and weather monitoring system with visualization and alerts

## Project Introduction
This dashboard provides a complete solution for monitoring environmental conditions using Node-RED as the core processing engine. It combines multiple data sources to deliver actionable insights about air quality, weather patterns, and pollution levels.

### Core Capabilities
* **Multi-parameter monitoring**: Track temperature, humidity, air quality indices (PM2.5, PM10, CO2)
* **Real-time visualization**: Dynamic charts with historical comparison
* **WhatsApp integration**: Instant alerts when thresholds are exceeded
* **Data storage**: Persistent logging with export functionality
* **Customizable thresholds**: User-definable alert levels

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Components
The system features several interconnected monitoring panels:
1. **Weather Overview**: Current conditions with forecast integration
2. **Air Quality Metrics**: Real-time pollution levels with health recommendations
3. **Historical Trends**: Pattern analysis with export capabilities
4. **Alert Configuration**: Customizable notification settings

> **Pro Tip**: The dashboard can be accessed from any device with a web browser, including mobile phones and tablets.
