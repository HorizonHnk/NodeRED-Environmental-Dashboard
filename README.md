Node-RED Environmental Monitoring Dashboard

A comprehensive pollution and weather monitoring system with visualization and alerts

Project Introduction
This dashboard provides a complete solution for monitoring environmental conditions using Node-RED as the core processing engine. It combines multiple data sources to deliver actionable insights about air quality, weather patterns, and pollution levels.
Core Capabilities

Multi-parameter monitoring: Track temperature, humidity, air quality indices (PM2.5, PM10, CO2)
Real-time visualization: Dynamic charts with historical comparison
WhatsApp integration: Instant alerts when thresholds are exceeded
Data storage: Persistent logging with export functionality
Customizable thresholds: User-definable alert levels

Implementation Details
Dashboard Components
The system features several interconnected monitoring panels:

Weather Overview: Current conditions with forecast integration
Air Quality Metrics: Real-time pollution levels with health recommendations
Historical Trends: Pattern analysis with export capabilities
Alert Configuration: Customizable notification settings


Pro Tip: The dashboard can be accessed from any device with a web browser, including mobile phones and tablets.
